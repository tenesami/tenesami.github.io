This is my third Portfolio project with the Flatiron school. I built this app for users who love to read and write proverbs. 

Most of us like to read motivational proverbs or quotes to find a meaningful guide in our day-to-day life experience. Some of us want to read some kind of inspirational thought to uplift ourselves and relax our mind from uncomfortable situations. May be one of us like to read thoughtful proverbs to keep our mind optimistic. 

But after a few days we forgot about what we read if we didnâ€™t take any sort of notes This is app is designed to solve for those types of user who love to read and take note about what they read for further reference.

The app helps users to organize the quotes based on author and topic. The user of this app can also read the available authors proverbs and quotes. If the user like to take notes of their favorite author quotes, they are able to do so. 

The app uses a PostgreSQL database. The front end of the app is built with vanilla JavaScript and the back end of the app is built with rails. User of this app can add and delete new Author and read and write proverbs of the author quotes.
