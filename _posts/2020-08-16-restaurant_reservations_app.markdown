Because of COVID 19 local business are straggling to survive in the business, especially restaurants are the one hit hard by the pandemic. The main goal of this app is to  solve this problem

Restaurant reservations app provide service	for customers to reserve tables.  If restaurant managers are aware how many customers will gone show up in their restaurant, it will be easy for them to keep their customers six feet apart. At the same time if the customers are aware that the restaurant practice social distancing they will feel safe to go out and eat at the restaurant. 

This how the app works, before users make reservation they need to create accounts in the app and log in. Once the users log in they can make reservations by typing the name of the restaurant and the number of tables they like to reserve. The user of this app can make multiple reservations. If the user changes their mind and want to edit their reservation entry they can edit, update and delete their reservations.
