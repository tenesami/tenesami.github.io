The main reason that let me decide to learn software engineering is the plenty of learning resource which are available online for free or little cost. These resources are very relevant for my busy schedule. It helps me to start coding from scratch through training myself well to the technology. Especially Codecademy helps me to build my confidence and a habit of coding.  
I do remember, after the long hours of work, the first thing I do when I get home is, practice coding. Coding help me to forget my long day of work by keeping me present. Eventually coding helps me to live for the moment. Once I start coding, I lost myself into it. I don’t even notice how the times fly. I keep coding until I fell sleep.  

The motives behind my dedication for coding every day is, the job opportunity software engineering has to offer. Based on my online little research Software engineering has a higher job opportunity in the US. According to the U.S Bureau of Labor Statics (BLS) “Software developer within the information industry claims 114,921 jobs per month with only 31,272 monthly hires, leaving a large gab of unfilled position.” This unfilled position gives me reason to study software engineering. As a result of this unsaturated position, some of software engineering employees don’t even have a college degree. As long those engineers clearly understand what they are doing these industries are open for everyone. 

Beside job opportunity with decent paying job anyone might also have a better chance to build his or her own website in the process of learning software engineering. The website that the student build will provide real work experience for students.
